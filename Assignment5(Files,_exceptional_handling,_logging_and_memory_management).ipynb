        "Q1 What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans\n",
        "An interpreted language is a programming language that is generally interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions. It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead, read and executed by some other program.\n",
        "\n",
        "While a compiled language is a programming language that is generally compiled and not interpreted. It is one where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine; this machine code is undecipherable by humans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2 What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Exception handling handles errors that occur during the execution of a program. It allows to respond to the error, instead of crashing the running program. It enables you to catch and manage errors, making your code more robust and user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3 What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans The finally block in programming commonly used as a block of code that is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4 What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Logging is tracking events that happen when the software runs. It is important for software developing, debugging, and running. If there is no logging record and the program crashes, there are very few chances to detect the cause of the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9 What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Multithreading is a system in which multiple threads are created of a process for increasing the computing speed of the system. In multithreading, many threads of a process are executed simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "While multiprocessing is a system that has more than one or two processors. In this CPUs are added to increase the computing speed of the system. Because of it there are many processes are executed simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10 What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans It helps to trace the execution of code, detect and fix bugs, optimize performance, and enhance security. Without proper logging practices, the development process can become challenging and time-consuming,\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11 What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans In Python, memory is managed by the Python manager which determines where to put the application data in the memory. So, we must have the knowledge of Python memory manager to write efficient code and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12 What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Steps:\n",
        "1. Surround Code with a try Block\n",
        "2. Specify Exception Handlers with except\n",
        "3. Handle Multiple Exceptions(only in the case with multiple exceptions)\n",
        "4. else block(only to execute code if no exceptions occur)\n",
        "5. finally block(only to perform cleanup actions, regardless of the outcome)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13 Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Effective memory management ensures optimal resource usage, prevents performance bottlenecks, and reduces the risk of application crashes.It handles this automatically, understanding its memory model helps to write efficient and scalable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14 What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans The try and except blocks to handle situations where errors and exceptions can interrupt the execution of program.In case an error occurs in try-block, it stops executing try block adn jumps to exception block. These blocks let us handle the errors without crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15 How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Garbage collection is a memory management technique used to automatically reclaim memory that is no longer accessible or in use by the application. It helps prevent memory leaks, optimize memory usage, and ensure efficient memory allocation for the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16 What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans It separates error-handling code from the main logic and makes it easier to identify which parts of the code handle errors and which execute under normal conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17 What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19 What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Closing files after use protects against difficult-to-debug issues such as running out of file handles or encountering corrupted data. Python does not flush the buffer that is writing data to the file until it is certain you are finished writing, which can be accomplished by closing the file. If you write to a file without closing it, the data will not be saved to the destination file.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20 What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans read() reads the entire file and returns a string whereas readline() reads just one line from a file\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21 What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Logging module is used to implement a flexible event-driven logging system, which serves as a convenient way of storing log events or messages for an application.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22 What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories,etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23 What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans While Python simplifies memory management with automatic garbage collection and dynamic memory allocation, challenges like circular references, memory leaks, and large object handling still require keen attention. Using profiling tools, memory-efficient libraries, and understanding Python’s memory model can help mitigate these challenges effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans We can use the assert statement and the sys.exc_info() function to raise and re-raise exceptions. raise keyword can be used to raise built-in exceptions, and custom exception classes can be created for more specific use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use of the assert statement and the sys.exc_info() function for raising exceptions in different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25  Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Multithreading is a crucial concept in modern computing that allows multiple threads to execute concurrently, enabling more efficient utilization of system resources. By breaking down tasks into smaller threads, applications can achieve higher performance, better responsiveness, and enhanced scalability. Whether it’s handling multiple user requests or performing complex operations in parallel, multithreading is an essential technique in both single-processor and multi-processor systems."
